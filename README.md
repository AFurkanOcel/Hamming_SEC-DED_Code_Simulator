# Hamming_SEC-DED_Code_Simulator
A Python-based graphical simulator for Hamming SEC-DED (Single Error Correction, Double Error Detection) codes. This GUI application allows users to select binary data lengths of 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits, enter binary input and generate the corresponding Hamming code with parity bits, inject a single-bit error at a specified position and visualize the corrupted data, and detect and correct the single-bit error using the syndrome value. The tool provides real-time feedback and logs all operations (encoding, error injection, correction) in a local text file (hamming_log.txt). It is an educational and interactive tool designed to help understand how Hamming SEC-DED codes work.
